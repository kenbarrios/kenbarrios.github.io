	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm a barista, living in Chicago. I became interested in front-end web design and development because a) I want to learn the skills to build a career in a field that is constantly growing and evolving and b) I suspect that basic web design will soon become a part of the standard grade school curriculum (and I'd like to stay ahead of the curve).</p>
	</div>	

	<h2>My Mission</h2>
		<p>As I learn more about front-end web development, I hope to work as a web developer with various left-wing groups and NGOs. Ideally, I would work in a progressive environment with people that are striving for a better world.</p>

	<h2>My Experience</h2>
		<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Barista</strong>, Starbucks 
  			<br><em>Chicago, June 2014 - Present</em></li>

  			<li><strong>Senior Accounts Receivable Specialist</strong>, Pierce & Assoc
  			<br><em>Chicago, January 2013 - May 2014</em></li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Education</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Bachelors</strong> in History and Poli Sci
			<br><em>NEIU, Chicago, 2002 - 2008</em></li>
		</ul>
