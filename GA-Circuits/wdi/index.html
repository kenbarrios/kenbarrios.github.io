		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>After earning my bachelor's degree in History and Political Science, I realized that what I had been studying was literally, and figuratively, in the past. I have now decided to pursue a career in Web Development because it is the future. As time goes on, the internet will only become more and more integrated into our daily lives.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I am currently taking the GA Web Design Circuit. The thing that pushed me to finally sign up for the course is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/28/play-i-robots/" target="_blank">an online ad</a> that I saw promoting a toy for toddlers. The toy is supposed to act as a rudimentary introduction to coding for pre-school-aged children. This left me floored.</p>
		<br>
		<p>After seeing that ad, I realized that a certain degree of web development would eventually be a standard part of everyone's grade school curriculum: "Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, and Coding."</p>
		<br>
		<p>I want to stay ahead of the curve and dive into Web Development immediately, and I think that General Assembly is the perfect guide for this journey.</p>
