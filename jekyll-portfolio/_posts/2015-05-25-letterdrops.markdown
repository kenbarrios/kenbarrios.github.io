**Instructions**

- There are two levels that involve falling "drops" with letters inside: the levels are called "Alphabetized" and "Randomized". As the drops fall, the user types the corresponding letter into the keyboard to pop the drop.

- There is a third level that involves several drops that contain entire words: the level is called "Words". The user must spell out the entire word, and once the spelling is completed the word drop will pop.


**Technologies used:**

- css keyframes for animation

- javascript & jQuery for game setup and logic

- ruby on rails for backend
