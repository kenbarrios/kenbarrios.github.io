      <h2>Politics</h2>
      <p>Politics are easily my primary passion. SYRIZA's storm to victory in Greece's January, 2015 elections kept me euphoric for a week.</p>

      <h2>Art</h2>
      <p>After politics, art is my true love. It is bitter sweet, though. My problem is that I'm not an artist. The best I can do is take semi-decent photographs of city-scapes and moments in daily life. Never the less, I appreciate art. Especially art for the people: street murals.</p>

      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>I haven't been able to travel as much as I'd like. But I've lived in Berkeley and San Francisco, CA. I've visited Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and India. I just recently visited Ecuador for two weeks.</p>
