	<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I'm a barista, living in Chicago. I became interested in front-end web development because a) I want to learn the skills to build a career in a field that is constantly growing and evolving and b) I suspect that basic web design will soon become a part of the standard grade school curriculum (and I'd like to stay ahead of the curve).</p>

	<h3>My Mission</h3>

	    <p>As I learn more about front-end web development, I hope to work as a web developer with various left-wing groups and NGOs. Ideally, I would work in a progressive environment with people that are striving for a better world.</p>
